Hello, and thank you for visiting this repository!

This project was originally developed during my time at the University of Birmingham as part of my efforts to deepen my understanding of C++ and DirectX, specifically using Direct2D for game development.

The core focus of the game is on integrating real-world physics simulations into well-structured code to create realistic motion for a spacecraft. Features include stage separation physics, variable gravity, drag, inertia, collision detection, and more.

While I had several ideas to expand this into a more engaging gameplay experience, the project has since been discontinued and will no longer receive updates.

All sprites and animations featured in the game were created by me.
